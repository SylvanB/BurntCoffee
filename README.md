# BurntCoffee
Follow my foray into language development with BurntCoffee, my attempt to create a language with Rust ðŸ¦€

Currently, I have no direction for a compilation target or over-arching design features - so this is mainly just a playground for building my understanding of languages, but this might change as time goes on. 

## Current Features
- Support for integer literals
- Support for Binary Expressions
- Basic arithmetic expression REPL (Read, Execute, Print, Loop)

## Langauge Feature To-do
- [ ] More types (bool, string literals, floats)
- [ ] Variables
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] More complex data structures (Lists?)
- [ ] More expression types (Unary, Ternary)

## Dev To-do
- [ ] Unit Tests ðŸ‘€

## Setup Guide
1. Follow the instructions on the Rust-lang site to install the Rust build tools
2. Clone this repo.
3. Within the repo directory, run `cargo run` to access the REPL.
